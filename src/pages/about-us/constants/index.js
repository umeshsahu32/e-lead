  INTRO: {
    DESCRIPTION:
      "elead is a bot-verified, AI-driven lead generation platform built to solve one core problem in sales and marketing: unverified intent. In a world flooded with clicks, forms, and raw data, elead exists to bring clarity, evidence, and accountability back into lead generation. We don't believe in selling volume. We believe in delivering proof-backed buyer intent.",
  },
  WHY_BUILT: {
    BADGE: "Why elead Was Built",
    TITLE: "The Problem with Traditional Leads",
    DESCRIPTION:
      "Most lead generation today is built around assumptions: a click is treated as interest, a form fill is treated as intent, a phone number is treated as opportunity. The result:",
    PROBLEMS: [
      "Sales teams chase low-intent prospects",
      "Marketers face disputes and distrust",
      "Businesses lose time, money, and momentum",

  PHILOSOPHY: {
    BADGE: "Our Philosophy",
    TITLE: "Proof Before Promise",
    DESCRIPTION:
      "At elead, we operate on a simple principle: If intent isn't verified, the lead shouldn't be delivered.",
    BELIEFS: [
      "Conversations matter more than clicks",
      "Evidence matters more than metrics",
      "Transparency matters more than claims",
    ],
    CONCLUSION:
      "Every system, service, and workflow at elead is designed around verifiable intent, not guesswork.",
  },

      "Their pricing and eligibility rules",
      "Their ideal customer profile",
      "Their qualification and disqualification logic",
    ],
